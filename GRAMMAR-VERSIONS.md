Grammar versions of releases
============================

Each release of the app can use a different parameter grammar version. Here is the correspondance table:

* release `0.15.1`: grammar `v2`
* release `0.15.0`: grammar `v2`, but `schedulingMinDelay` and `schedulingMeanDelay` are ignored
* release `0.14.0`: grammar `v1`
* release `0.13.1`: grammar `v1`
* release `0.13`: grammar `v1`
* release `0.12`: grammar `v1`, and fetched from the github parameters repository
* release `0.11`: grammar `v1`, but not fetched from the github parameters repository (the first version to do that is `0.12`)
* releases prior to `0.11`: no grammar defined
