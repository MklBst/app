Grammar versions of releases
============================

Each release of the app can use a different parameter grammar version. Here is the correspondance table:

* release `0.12`: grammar `v1`, and feteched from the github parameters repository
* release `0.11`: grammar `v1`, but not fetched from the github parameters repository (the first version to do that is `0.12`)
* releases prior to `0.11`: no grammar defined
